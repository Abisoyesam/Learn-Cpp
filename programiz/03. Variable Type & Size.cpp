/*
	Int can store integer usually in 4 bytes. (32 bits)	2^32 distinct integer.
	
	Both 'float' and 'double' stores number with decimal. Float is 4 bytes while double is 8 bytes.
	
	Always use 'double' for decimal no b'cos it has better precision. Float has 6-7 decimals while double has 15 decimals.
	
	Char is used to store single character. Always has 1 byte size and single quote.
	
	Bool: two value either true or false, and it 1 byte.
	
	String: to store sequence of characters (text). It's not built-in data type but it behave like one in its most usage.
